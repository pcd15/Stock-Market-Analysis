### Abstract:
The Federal Reserve works to maintain stable economic growth (as measured by the inflation rate) by influencing interest rates; when inflation rises to a level deemed too high (as it it now), the Fed responds by raising interest rates, in an attempt to limit borrowing and thus slow economic growth and (hopefully) prevent the American economy from overheating. More specifically within the context of this year, interest has ballooned from nearly 0% at the beginning of the year to about 4% currently (the highest it’s been since the 2008 recession), as inflation has been trending at about 8% in recent months. The current high-rate economic climate has led to a stock-market slump, with the S&P 500 index having fallen 13% year to date, signaling a potential recession in the near future. With our research, we sought to explore the relationship between stock-market performance and interest and inflation rates, both throughout the past several decades and in more recent years, to determine whether the current negative correlation between rates and returns has also held true in the past. Furthermore, we also sought to discover whether companies within certain sectors have performed better than others recently, given the high rates characteristic of this year. Through our analyses, we found that there does seem a negative correlation between interest/inflation rates and stock-market returns, though this relationship is somewhat convoluted by recessionary periods, and we determined that certain sectors–specifically, those deemed to be essential (e.g., energy)--have performed better this past year relative to nonessential sectors.
