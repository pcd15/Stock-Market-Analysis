In doing so, we hope to determine economic characteristics in which it's beneficial to invest in the stock market, as well as if/when certain companies or sectors perform better in different economic climates. Therefore, we are interested in answering the following questions:\n\n-   How have these rates (inflation and interest) historically impacted the returns of the stock market?\n\n-   How closely has the current performance of the market (the past two years) followed these historical trends?\n\n-   And finally, does the current high-rate economic climate disproportionately affect some companies/sectors more than others? If so, why?\n\nWe believe the overall stock market would be hurt by high inflation and corresponding high interest rates, both because consumers' discretionary incomes drop and because companies are disincentivized from borrowing, due to the higher costs associated with taking out a loan. We expect to see this relationship in both our historical analysis and our current-day analysis. Conversely, in times of lower rates, we expect market returns to be higher, on average. Though we expect the stock market as a whole to suffer from high rates, we believe certain sectors of the economy could serve as silver linings for investors' pockets; these industries include: financials, health care, utilities, and consumer staples. We believe these sectors could perform better than the aggregate market because they sell essential goods that consumers must purchase no matter the state of the economy (health care, utilities, and consumer staples). Also, we believe the financials sector will do well because banks are able to charge higher interest rates on their loans (and thus earn greater profits) when interest rates are high.\n\nNote: We are using the S&P 500 as a model of the performance of the entire market, and we are using the federal-funds rate, the interest rate at which banks loan to other banks, to model the general trend of all interest rates. We believed these are logical assumptions, as the S&P 500 includes the 500 largest US-based companies (and thus covers a large portion of the total market) and the federal-funds rate generally serves as a benchmark for all other interest rates (because it is indirectly influenced by the Federal Reserve's policies). Also, all of our observations feature the performance of the market (S&P 500) or an individual company in the S&P 500 on a specific day/month/year.\n\n\\newpage\n\n# Part 1: Historical Analysis\n\nSources:\n\n-   Federal Funds Rate and Inflation Rate: Macrotrends (<https://www.macrotrends.net/2015/fed-funds-rate-historical-chart>)\n\n-   S&P 500 Annual Returns: Slickcharts (https://www.slickcharts.com/sp500/returns)\n\n-   Monthly Statistics (scraped): Official Data (https://www.officialdata.org/us/stocks/s-p-500/1900).\n\nAll of these sites collected these data by retrieving the data published publicly on stock exchanges, except for the federal-funds rate--this data was collected from the World Bank.

To do so, we utilized a line graph to see their trends across time--more specifically, from 1961 to 2020. As you can see in the graph above, these rates are very closely related (especially prior to 2000), with interest and inflation peaking and dipping at similar times. This trend makes sense, as the Federal Reserve tends to raise the federal-funds (interest) rate when inflation rises, in an attempt to slow the economy down. (This is why the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates now--more on that later.)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#|: interest-inflation-and-market-returns-graph\n\ncolors_redux <- c(\"Inflation\" = \"blue\", \"Interest\" = \"red\", \"Market Returns\" = \"green\")\n\nhistorical_data |>\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = mean_fed_funds_rate, color = \"Interest\")) +\n  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = inflation_rate, color = \"Inflation\")) +\n  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = year_to_date_return, color = \"Market Returns\")) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Impacts of Interest Rates and Inflation Rates on Market Returns\",\n    subtitle = \"1961 - 2020\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Average Annual Rate (%)\",\n    color = \"Type\"\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n    legend.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)\n  ) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = colors_redux) +\n  scale_color_viridis_d()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nScale for 'colour' is already present.

As depicted in the graph, market returns are extremely volatile and (at least according to this graph) doesn't seem to depend on either interest or inflation, contrary to our hypothesis.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#|: best-ten-years-of-returns\n\nhistorical_data_best <- historical_data |> \n  distinct(year, mean_fed_funds_rate, inflation_rate, year_to_date_return) |>\n  arrange(desc(year_to_date_return)) |>\n  slice_head(n = 10) |> \n  relocate(year, year_to_date_return)\n\nhistorical_data_best\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 10 × 4\n    year year_to_date_return inflation_rate mean_fed_funds_rate\n   <dbl>               <dbl>          <dbl>               <dbl>\n 1  1995                37.6           2.81                5.83\n 2  1975                37.2           9.14                5.82\n 3  1997                33.4           2.34                5.46\n 4  1980                32.4          13.5                13.4 \n 5  2013                32.4           1.46                0.11\n 6  1985                31.7           3.55                8.1 \n 7  1989                31.7           4.83                9.21\n 8  2019                31.5           1.81                2.16\n 9  1991                30.5           4.24                5.69\n10  2003                28.7           2.27                1.13\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#|: worst-ten-years-of-returns\n\nhistorical_data_worst <- historical_data |> \n  distinct(year, mean_fed_funds_rate, inflation_rate, year_to_date_return) |>\n  arrange(year_to_date_return) |>\n  slice_head(n = 10) |> \n  relocate(year, year_to_date_return)\n\nhistorical_data_worst\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 10 × 4\n    year year_to_date_return inflation_rate mean_fed_funds_rate\n   <dbl>               <dbl>          <dbl>               <dbl>\n 1  2008              -37              3.84                1.92\n 2  1974              -26.5           11.1                10.5 \n 3  2002              -22.1            1.59                1.67\n 4  1973              -14.7            6.18                8.74\n 5  2001              -11.9            2.83                3.88\n 6  1966              -10.1            3.02                5.11\n 7  2000               -9.1            3.38                6.24\n 8  1962               -8.73           1.20                2.71\n 9  1969               -8.5            5.46                8.21\n10  1977               -7.18           6.50                5.54\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNext, we determined the best and worst 10 years of performance for the stock market by sorting by year_to_date_return, in order to examine the years individually rather than as a trend across time. Many of the best years feature at least one relatively low rate (\\<5%), with many having both low interest and inflation rates. Noticeable outliers include 1980, whose rates were both over 13%, and 1975, whose interest rate was almost 6% and inflation 9%. This trend of high returns correlating with lower rates does support our hypothesis. On the other hand, we expected many of the worst years for market returns to have high rates; surprisingly, this was not the case for about half of the worst years. Though some years did support our hypothesis, including 1974, 1973, 1969, and 1977, the others featured surprisingly low rates. We suspect that these unanticipated poor performance of the stock market during times of low rates could possibly be explained by recessions occurring during these years; in recessionary gaps, inflation tends to be lower because the economy has slowed significantly, and interest rates tend to be low as well in an attempt to re-stimulate the economy by encouraging borrowing.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#|: creating-df-of-averages-of-returns-and-rates-by-decade\n# excluded 2020 because it's not a whole decade\n\nhistorical_data_decade <- historical_data |>\n  filter(decade != \"2020\") |>\n  group_by(decade) |>\n  summarize(\n    mean_return = mean(year_to_date_return),\n    mean_interest = mean(mean_fed_funds_rate),\n    mean_inflation = mean(inflation_rate)\n  ) |>\n  arrange(desc(mean_return))\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#|: visualization-of-rates-by-decade\n\nhistorical_data_decade |>\n  pivot_longer( \n    !decade, \n    names_to = \"type\",\n    values_to = \"rate\"\n  ) |>\n  mutate(\n    type = as.factor(type),\n    type = fct_rev(type)\n  ) |>\n  ggplot(aes(x = type, y = rate, fill = type)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  facet_wrap(~decade, ncol = 3) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Mean Returns and Rates by Decade\",\n    subtitle = \"1960s - 2010s\",\n    y = \"Mean Rate\",\n    fill = \"Type\"\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d() + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n    legend.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n    axis.title.x = element_blank(),\n    axis.text.x = element_blank()\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](report_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFor the last part of our historical analysis, we wanted to examine the averages of returns, interest, and inflation by decade. To do so, we created a bar chart for each decade (using geom_col() and facet_wrap()). This graph supports what we concluded after examining the best and worst 10 years of returns: higher returns seem to be common in times of low rates, but it's difficult to determine a relationship between returns and rates when returns are lower. For example, the '60s, '90s, and 2010s all featured high returns (\\~10+%) and rates at or below 5%; an outlier decade is the 2000s, whose average return was an abysmal \\~1% despite low rates. On the other hand, in decades when rates were high (the '70s and '80s), returns were much more volatile--decent in the '70s (7.5%) yet great in the '80s (15+%).\n\nConclusion: Our initial hypothesis was partially correct. It seems that high returns in the stock market generally correlate with lower interest and inflation rates, but years with lower returns can't be explained as neatly, at least with the data we're using. A potential confounding variable could be whether our economy was experiencing a recession during that year, as recessions sometimes create environments where returns in the stock market are poor even in times of low rates.\n\n\\newpage\n\n# Part 2: Current-day Analysis\n\nSource:\n\n-   Investing.com (https://www.investing.com/indices/us-spx-500-historical-data)\n\nInvesting.com gets their data from financial-data providers, including stock exchanges and/or directly from market makers (who set stock prices to match supply and demand).
