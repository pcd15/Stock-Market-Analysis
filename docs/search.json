    "text": "Introduction and data\nData set 1 comes from 4 sources. The data on the federal-funds rate and inflation rate were obtained from Macrotrends (https://www.macrotrends.net/2015/fed-funds-rate-historical-chart), the data on S&P 500 yearly total returns was obtained from Slickcharts (https://www.slickcharts.com/sp500/returns), and the data for monthly statistics was obtained Official Data (https://www.officialdata.org/us/stocks/s-p-500/1900). The data was collected by retrieving the data publicly published on the stock-market exchange. Each observation represents a different month in a given year. For each month, we’ve compiled the return on investment, as well as the the cumulative value of $100 invested in January of 1900; for each year, we’ve compiled the mean federal-funds rate, inflation rate, YTD returns, and annual change in inflation, all of which are included in historical_data. While the data shows heavy fluctuations, we see that federal funds and inflation rate both peaked around 1980. No ethical concerns."

    "text": "Research question\nWith data set 1, we would like to answer the following question: How have interest rates and inflation rates historically impacted the stock market? Tracking historical trends can be useful in maximizing profit from the bullish or bearish market, making it significant for investors or fin-tech workers. Our data assesses the impact of quantitative variables such as interest rate and inflation rate. It also assesses categorical variables such as time and whether or not interest rate and inflation rate rose or fell (TRUE if they rose, FALSE if they fell). Our hypothesis is that the stock market (generalized by the S&P 500 index) would be hurt by high inflation and corresponding high interest rates (generalized by the federal-funds rate) because consumers’ discretionary incomes drop and companies are disincentivized from borrowing due to the higher costs associated with taking out a loan."

The data is collected daily (well really, every second), and it is collected by monitoring various operations (selling, buying, etc.) done in the stock market, which lead to increases and decreases in prices (which are then ultimately collected). Each observation represents a different day this year, with each day having data on the high/low/opening/closing prices, differences in high/low and opening/closing prices, daily percentage change, and whether the change in price for the day was a gain. The observations show heavy fluctuation as expected with something as volatile as the stock market, but this year a general decline in share prices is evident, which could partially be attributed to inflation and interest rates.

    "text": "Research question\n\nWith the highest inflation rates ever seen, traders and those who work in the financial industry are even more unsure about how to go about trading in the stock market. Of course it is difficult to ever predict the market, but even more so in times like this. With this dataset, we would like to address the following question: how have high inflation rates and interest rates impacted the S&P 500 this year? And how does this compare to the stock market’s historical performance in similar economic times? This question is important as people want to know that when they invest in something, generally their money is safe. In times like these, it’s hard to say when it is actually safe to invest in something, and so we want to dive deeper into when you might actually want to be bullish or bearish in times like these. Our hypothesis is the following: while the stock market will fall as inflation rates rise (which are followed by interest rates as well), there are good times to invest even with the problematic circumstances. Our variables are mostly quantitative, analyzing interest rates, inflation rates, stock price rise and falls, while the categorical variables are the date and whether or not there was a net gain or loss (categorized by TRUE if gain and FALSE if not) on the day."

    "text": "Introduction\nWe want to explore the relationship between interest and inflation rates and the performance of the stock market. In doing so, we hope to determine economic characteristics in which it’s beneficial to invest in the stock market, as well as if/when certain companies or sectors perform better in different economic climates. Therefore, we are interested in answering the following questions:\n\nHow have these rates (inflation and interest) historically impacted the returns of the stock market?\nHow closely has the current performance of the market (the past two years) followed these historical trends?\nAnd finally, does the current high-rate economic climate disproportionately affect some companies/sectors more than others? If so, why?\n\nWe believe the overall stock market would be hurt by high inflation and corresponding high interest rates, both because consumers’ discretionary incomes drop and because companies are disincentivized from borrowing, due to the higher costs associated with taking out a loan. We expect to see this relationship in both our historical analysis and our current-day analysis. Conversely, in times of lower rates, we expect market returns to be higher, on average. Though we expect the stock market as a whole to suffer from high rates, we believe certain sectors of the economy could serve as silver linings for investors’ pockets; these industries include: financials, health care, utilities, and consumer staples. We believe these sectors could perform better than the aggregate market because they sell essential goods that consumers must purchase no matter the state of the economy (health care, utilities, and consumer staples). Also, we believe the financials sector will do well because banks are able to charge higher interest rates on their loans (and thus earn greater profits) when interest rates are high.\nNote: We are using the S&P 500 as a model of the performance of the entire market, and we are using the federal-funds rate, the interest rate at which banks loan to other banks, to model the general trend of all interest rates. We believed these are logical assumptions, as the S&P 500 includes the 500 largest US-based companies (and thus covers a large portion of the total market) and the federal-funds rate generally serves as a benchmark for all other interest rates (because it is indirectly influenced by the Federal Reserve’s policies). Also, all of our observations feature the performance of the market (S&P 500) or an individual company in the S&P 500 on a specific day/month/year.\n\n\n\nPart 1: Historical Analysis\nSources:\n\nFederal Funds Rate and Inflation Rate: Macrotrends (https://www.macrotrends.net/2015/fed-funds-rate-historical-chart)\nS&P 500 Annual Returns: Slickcharts (https://www.slickcharts.com/sp500/returns)\nMonthly Statistics (scraped): Official Data (https://www.officialdata.org/us/stocks/s-p-500/1900).\n\nAll of these sites collected these data by retrieving the data published publicly on stock exchanges, except for the federal-funds rate–this data was collected from the World Bank. In addition, each of these sites updates their data monthly/yearly (although they could update it daily, as they are collecting live data). Each observation represents a month in a year (between 1961 and 2020) and includes the following variables:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nDefinition\n\n\n\n\nyear\nyear in which observation was recorded\n\n\nmonth\nmonth in which observation was recorded\n\n\nmonthly_return\ntotal stock market’s monthly return\n\n\nyear_to_date_return\nS&P 500’s yearly return\n\n\nmean_fed_funds_rate\nmean annual interest rate set by the Federal Reserve\n\n\ninflation rate\nmean annual inflation rate\n\n\ndecade\nrepresents decade in which observation was made\n\n\n\n\n#|: loading-historical-data\n\nhistorical_data <- read_csv(\"data/historical_data.csv\")\nglimpse(historical_data)\n\nRows: 720\nColumns: 10\n$ year                    <dbl> 1961, 1961, 1961, 1961, 1961, 1961, 1961, 1961…\n$ month                   <dbl> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3…\n$ monthly_return          <chr> \"4.37%\", \"3.40%\", \"2.92%\", \"1.26%\", \"-1.08%\", …\n$ monthly_avg_price       <dbl> 25134.18, 25988.00, 26746.59, 27084.50, 26791.…\n$ inflation_rate          <dbl> 1.0707, 1.0707, 1.0707, 1.0707, 1.0707, 1.0707…\n$ inflation_annual_change <dbl> -0.39, -0.39, -0.39, -0.39, -0.39, -0.39, -0.3…\n$ mean_fed_funds_rate     <dbl> 1.95, 1.95, 1.95, 1.95, 1.95, 1.95, 1.95, 1.95…\n$ year_to_date_return     <dbl> 26.89, 26.89, 26.89, 26.89, 26.89, 26.89, 26.8…\n$ time_period             <chr> \"not so recent\", \"not so recent\", \"not so rece…\n$ decade                  <chr> \"'60s\", \"'60s\", \"'60s\", \"'60s\", \"'60s\", \"'60s\"…\n\n\n\n#|: inflation-vs-interest-plot\n# Completed with assistance from: https://community.rstudio.com/t/adding-manual-legend-to-ggplot2/41651/5\n\ncolors <- c(\"Inflation\" = \"blue\", \"Interest\" = \"red\")\n\nggplot(historical_data) +\n  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = mean_fed_funds_rate, color = \"Interest\")) +\n  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = inflation_rate, color = \"Inflation\")) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Interest Rates vs. Inflation Rates\",\n    subtitle = \"1961 - 2020\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Average Annual Rate (%)\",\n    color = \"Type\"\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n    legend.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)\n  ) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = colors) +\n  scale_color_viridis_d()\n\nScale for 'colour' is already present.

To do so, we utilized a line graph to see their trends across time–more specifically, from 1961 to 2020. As you can see in the graph above, these rates are very closely related (especially prior to 2000), with interest and inflation peaking and dipping at similar times. This trend makes sense, as the Federal Reserve tends to raise the federal-funds (interest) rate when inflation rises, in an attempt to slow the economy down. (This is why the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates now–more on that later.)\n\n#|: interest-inflation-and-market-returns-graph\n\ncolors_redux <- c(\"Inflation\" = \"blue\", \"Interest\" = \"red\", \"Market Returns\" = \"green\")\n\nhistorical_data |>\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = mean_fed_funds_rate, color = \"Interest\")) +\n  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = inflation_rate, color = \"Inflation\")) +\n  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = year_to_date_return, color = \"Market Returns\")) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Impacts of Interest Rates and Inflation Rates on Market Returns\",\n    subtitle = \"1961 - 2020\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Average Annual Rate (%)\",\n    color = \"Type\"\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n    legend.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)\n  ) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = colors_redux) +\n  scale_color_viridis_d()\n\nScale for 'colour' is already present. Adding another scale for 'colour',\nwhich will replace the existing scale.\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, we analyzed the relationship between rates and average yearly returns of the stock market for the same period using another line graph. As depicted in the graph, market returns are extremely volatile and (at least according to this graph) doesn’t seem to depend on either interest or inflation, contrary to our hypothesis.\n\n#|: best-ten-years-of-returns\n\nhistorical_data_best <- historical_data |> \n  distinct(year, mean_fed_funds_rate, inflation_rate, year_to_date_return) |>\n  arrange(desc(year_to_date_return)) |>\n  slice_head(n = 10) |> \n  relocate(year, year_to_date_return)\n\nhistorical_data_best\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 4\n    year year_to_date_return inflation_rate mean_fed_funds_rate\n   <dbl>               <dbl>          <dbl>               <dbl>\n 1  1995                37.6           2.81                5.83\n 2  1975                37.2           9.14                5.82\n 3  1997                33.4           2.34                5.46\n 4  1980                32.4          13.5                13.4 \n 5  2013                32.4           1.46                0.11\n 6  1985                31.7           3.55                8.1 \n 7  1989                31.7           4.83                9.21\n 8  2019                31.5           1.81                2.16\n 9  1991                30.5           4.24                5.69\n10  2003                28.7           2.27                1.13\n\n\n\n#|: worst-ten-years-of-returns\n\nhistorical_data_worst <- historical_data |> \n  distinct(year, mean_fed_funds_rate, inflation_rate, year_to_date_return) |>\n  arrange(year_to_date_return) |>\n  slice_head(n = 10) |> \n  relocate(year, year_to_date_return)\n\nhistorical_data_worst\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 4\n    year year_to_date_return inflation_rate mean_fed_funds_rate\n   <dbl>               <dbl>          <dbl>               <dbl>\n 1  2008              -37              3.84                1.92\n 2  1974              -26.5           11.1                10.5 \n 3  2002              -22.1            1.59                1.67\n 4  1973              -14.7            6.18                8.74\n 5  2001              -11.9            2.83                3.88\n 6  1966              -10.1            3.02                5.11\n 7  2000               -9.1            3.38                6.24\n 8  1962               -8.73           1.20                2.71\n 9  1969               -8.5            5.46                8.21\n10  1977               -7.18           6.50                5.54\n\n\nNext, we determined the best and worst 10 years of performance for the stock market by sorting by year_to_date_return, in order to examine the years individually rather than as a trend across time. Many of the best years feature at least one relatively low rate (<5%), with many having both low interest and inflation rates. Noticeable outliers include 1980, whose rates were both over 13%, and 1975, whose interest rate was almost 6% and inflation 9%. This trend of high returns correlating with lower rates does support our hypothesis. On the other hand, we expected many of the worst years for market returns to have high rates; surprisingly, this was not the case for about half of the worst years. Though some years did support our hypothesis, including 1974, 1973, 1969, and 1977, the others featured surprisingly low rates. We suspect that these unanticipated poor performance of the stock market during times of low rates could possibly be explained by recessions occurring during these years; in recessionary gaps, inflation tends to be lower because the economy has slowed significantly, and interest rates tend to be low as well in an attempt to re-stimulate the economy by encouraging borrowing.\n\n#|: creating-df-of-averages-of-returns-and-rates-by-decade\n# excluded 2020 because it's not a whole decade\n\nhistorical_data_decade <- historical_data |>\n  filter(decade != \"2020\") |>\n  group_by(decade) |>\n  summarize(\n    mean_return = mean(year_to_date_return),\n    mean_interest = mean(mean_fed_funds_rate),\n    mean_inflation = mean(inflation_rate)\n  ) |>\n  arrange(desc(mean_return))\n\n\n#|: visualization-of-rates-by-decade\n\nhistorical_data_decade |>\n  pivot_longer( \n    !decade, \n    names_to = \"type\",\n    values_to = \"rate\"\n  ) |>\n  mutate(\n    type = as.factor(type),\n    type = fct_rev(type)\n  ) |>\n  ggplot(aes(x = type, y = rate, fill = type)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  facet_wrap(~decade, ncol = 3) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Mean Returns and Rates by Decade\",\n    subtitle = \"1960s - 2010s\",\n    y = \"Mean Rate\",\n    fill = \"Type\"\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d() + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n    legend.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n    axis.title.x = element_blank(),\n    axis.text.x = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\nFor the last part of our historical analysis, we wanted to examine the averages of returns, interest, and inflation by decade. To do so, we created a bar chart for each decade (using geom_col() and facet_wrap()). This graph supports what we concluded after examining the best and worst 10 years of returns: higher returns seem to be common in times of low rates, but it’s difficult to determine a relationship between returns and rates when returns are lower. For example, the ’60s, ’90s, and 2010s all featured high returns (~10+%) and rates at or below 5%; an outlier decade is the 2000s, whose average return was an abysmal ~1% despite low rates. On the other hand, in decades when rates were high (the ’70s and ’80s), returns were much more volatile–decent in the ’70s (7.5%) yet great in the ’80s (15+%).\nConclusion: Our initial hypothesis was partially correct. It seems that high returns in the stock market generally correlate with lower interest and inflation rates, but years with lower returns can’t be explained as neatly, at least with the data we’re using. A potential confounding variable could be whether our economy was experiencing a recession during that year, as recessions sometimes create environments where returns in the stock market are poor even in times of low rates.\n\n\n\nPart 2: Current-day Analysis\nSource:\n\nInvesting.com (https://www.investing.com/indices/us-spx-500-historical-data)\n\nInvesting.com gets their data from financial-data providers, including stock exchanges and/or directly from market makers (who set stock prices to match supply and demand).
