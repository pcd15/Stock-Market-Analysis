The data on the federal-funds rate and inflation rate were obtained from Macrotrends (https://www.macrotrends.net/2015/fed-funds-rate-historical-chart). The data on S&P 500 yearly total returns was obtained from Slickcharts (https://www.slickcharts.com/sp500/returns). The data was collected by retrieving the data publicly published on the stock-market exchange. Each obsevrvation represents a different year; for each year, we’ve compiled the mean federal-funds rate, inflation rate, YTD returns, and annual change in inflation, all of which are included in historical_data. While the data shows heavy fluctuations, we see that federal funds and inflation rate both peaked around 1980. No ethical concerns."

Tracking historical trends can be useful in maximizing profit from the bullish or bearish market, making it significant for investors or fin-tech workers. Our data assess the impact of quantitative variables such as interest rate and inflation rate. It also assesses categorical variables such as time and whether or not interest rate and inflation rate rose or fell (TRUE if they rose, FALSE if they fell). Our hypothesis is that the stock market (generalized by the S&P 500 index) would be hurt by high inflation and corresponding high interest rates (generalized by the federal-funds rate) because consumers’ discretionary incomes drop and companies are disincentivized from borrowing due to the higher costs associated with taking out a loan."

Of course it is difficult to ever predict the market, but even more so in times like this. With this dataset, we would like to address the following question: how have high inflation rates and interest rates impacted the S&P 500 this year? And how does this compare to the stock market’s historical performance in similar economic times? This question is important as people want to know that when they invest in something, generally their money is safe. In times like these, it’s hard to say when it is actually safe to invest in something, and so we want to delve deeper into when you might actually want to be bullish or bearish in times like these. Our hypothesis is the following: while the stock market will fall as inflation rates rise (which are followed by interest rates as well), there are good times to invest even with the problematic circumstances. Our variables are mostly quantitative, analyzing interest rates, inflation rates, stock price rise and falls, while the categorical variables are the date and whether or not there was a net gain or loss (categorized by TRUE if gain and FALSE if not) on the day."
